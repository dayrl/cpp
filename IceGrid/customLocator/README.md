To run the demo, first start the IceGrid service:

      icegridnode --Ice.Config=config.grid

Note that for debug Windows builds you will need to use icegridnoded
rather than icegridnode as the executable name.

In a separate window start the custom locator:

      locator

Now in another window deploy the application:

      icegridadmin --Ice.Config=config.grid -e "application add application.xml"

The custom locator included in this demo only allows clients that set a
specific value in the Locator proxy context to obtain a proxy to the server
object.

To run the client without setting this value:

      client

To run the client with the context set properly:

      client --context
