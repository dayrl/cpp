A simple throughput demo that allows you to send sequences of various
types between client and server and to measure the maximum bandwidth
that can be achieved using serialized synchronous requests.

To run the demo, first start the server:

      server

In a separate window, start the client:

      client

We provide a number of optimizations through metadata in this demo.

Bytes sequences
--------------

For in parameters we use the `cpp:array` metadata which on the server 
side means that the operation implementation is passed pointers into 
the marshaling buffer which eliminates a copy of the sequence data.

For return parameters we also use the `cpp:array` metadata, but this
time in conjunction with AMD. Doing this also reduces the number of
times the returned sequence is copied during marshaling.

Strings
-------

We use a custom mapping for strings: instead of the default `std::string`,
we use our own lightweight `Util::string_view` type, which does not 
allocate memory.
 
`string_view` is similar to `boost::string_ref` and to the proposed
experimental C++14 `string_view`.

The resulting behavior is similar to the `cpp:array` behavior for bytes 
sequences, with the `string_view` "pointing" to the Ice marshaling buffer. 

Like the `cpp:array` metadata, the `cpp:view-type` metadata changes the
mapped type only when it's safe to reference memory. In particular,
`cpp:array` and `cpp:view-type` have no effect for regular returned 
parameters and out parameters, such as:  
```
// Slice
["cpp:view-type:`std::vector`<`Util::string_view`>"] StringSeq recvStringSeq();

//
// C++ 
// Mapped to the default `std::vector`<string>, and not `std::vector`<`Util::string_view`>
//
stringVect = prx->recvStringSeq();
```
If you use `cpp:type` above instead of `cpp:view-type`, you would get a
`std::vector`<`Util::string_view`>, with the `string_view` objects pointing to 
deallocated memory:
```
// Slice - you should _not_ use cpp:type here!
["cpp:type:`std::vector`<`Util::string_view`>"] StringSeq recvStringSeq();

//
// C++ 
// Mapped to `std::vector`<`Util::string_view`>
//
stringViewVect = prx->recvStringSeq(); // very dangerous, as the string_views
                                       // point to deallocated memory 
```
