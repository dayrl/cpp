This demo is a C++ commandline client for the [ZeroC Chat Demo](https://zeroc.com/chat/index.html). This demo connects to a single chat room, allowing you to chat with other chat room participants.

By default, the demo connects to the chat server hosted on demo.zeroc.com through a WebSocket reverse proxy hosted on zeroc.com.

You may run either the Glacier2 client (`chatgl2client`) or the polling client (`chatpollclient`), as well as any username or password to connect.

If you wish to use your own server from the `server` direcory you should specify the appropriate custom configuration file when launching the client:


     chatgl2client --Ice.Config=config.gl2client
     chatpollclient --Ice.Config=config.pollclient
