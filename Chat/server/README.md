This demo is the server for the [ZeroC Chat Demo](https://zeroc.com/chat/index.html).

The chat demo server implements two different session systems, one
using Glacier2 sessions and callbacks, and the other one using a
custom session mechanism for Ice clients that cannot use callbacks.

The Slice definitions for the chat demo are:

- `slice/ChatSession.ice`: Definitions for Glacier2 clients (C++, Java, .NET, JavaScript)

- `slice/PollingChat.ice`: Definitions for non-Glacier2 clients (PHP)

You can use this demo if you want to host your own Chat Demo server.

To run the server:

    $ chatserver --Ice.Config=config.chatserver

For push clients Glacier2 is also required, to start it run the following in a 
new shell:

    $ glacier2router --Ice.Config=config.glacier2router
